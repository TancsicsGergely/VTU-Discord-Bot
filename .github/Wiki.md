## Are new to `Discord.py`?


#### Then let me introduce it to you. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29))
<p>Python is a multi-purpose programming language which can be used for discord. This part is usually called <strong>Discord.py</strong>. For <em>VTU Discord Bot</em> we are using the <em>asyncio</em> branch. If you want us to add your feature you **must** use this branch.</p>
